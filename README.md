# Files associated with the FWADA model associated with the manuscript: TITLE (w/ link?)

Food Waste Anaerobic Digestor Allocation (FWADA) model. These files show the R code used to develop the FWADA model.

### Description of Files

Adjacency.Rmd - the method of establishing adjacent FW clusters developed for the FWADA model.  
Estimate_GHG.Rmd - generating a collection route and calculating net GHG emissions for a single cluster.  
Model_Processes.Rmd - Two functions developed to change size of FW clusters in the FWADA model.

functions_supp_files.R - includes the FWADA model used with Monte Carlo simulation in this study as well as functions to calculate net GHG and other statistics for the clusters

All files developed by Lauren Mabe
