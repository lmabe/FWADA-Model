# Files associated with the FWADA model associated with the manuscript: "A cluster-based spatial analysis of recycling boundaries aligning anaerobic digestion infrastructure with food waste generation in California" (Mabe, Pace, Spang 2022)

Food Waste Anaerobic Digestor Allocation (FWADA) model

### Description of Files

Adjacency.Rmd - the method of establishing adjacent FW clusters developed for the FWADA model.  
Estimate_GHG.Rmd - generating a collection route and calculating net GHG emissions for a single cluster.  
Model_Processes.Rmd - Two functions developed to change size of FW clusters in the FWADA model.

FWG_dataset.zip - a zipped folder containing the Food Waste Geography (FWG) shapefile

functions_supp_files.R - includes the FWADA model in it's entirety as well as functions to calculate net GHG and other statistics for the clusters. These files were used with Monte Carlo simulation to generate results for this study.
